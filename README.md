# Aura.Filter

This package provides tools to validate and sanitize objects and arrays.

## Foreword

### Installation

This library requires PHP 5.4 or later; we recommend using the latest available version of PHP as a matter of principle. It has no userland dependencies.

It is installable and autoloadable via Composer as [aura/filter](https://packagist.org/packages/aura/filter).

Alternatively, [download a release](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Filter/releases) or clone this repository, then require or include its _autoload.php_ file.

To run the unit tests at the command line, issue `composer install` and then `phpunit` at the package root. This requires [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to be available as `composer`, and [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/manual/) to be available as `phpunit`.

This library attempts to comply with [PSR-1][], [PSR-2][], and [PSR-4][]. If
you notice compliance oversights, please send a patch via pull request.

## Getting Started

This document gives a general overview of how to use the library, but we also
have these pages available:

- [Validator rules](README-VALIDATE.md) (rules that validate field values)
- [Sanitizer rules](README-SANITIZE.md) (rules that sanitize field values)
- [Custom rules](README-CUSTOM.md) (how to write custom filter rules)

### Terminology

Unfortunately, there are few common terms shared between filtering/validating/etc.
libraries. To clear up misconception, this library uses the following
definitions:

- "field": an array element or object property

- "validate": determine if a field value conforms to a particular format,
  but do not modify the field value

- "sanitize": modify, transform, or otherwise force a field value to conform
  to a particular format

- "filter": validate and/or sanitize one or more fields

- "subject": the array or object being filtered

### Instantiation

The easiest way to instantiate a new _Filter_ is to use the _FilterFactory_
class:

```php
<?php
use Aura\Filter\FilterFactory;

$filter_factory = new FilterFactory();
$filter = $filter_factory->newFilter();
?>
```

### Adding Rule Specifications

Add rule specifications to the filter for each subject field.

```php
<?php
// the username must be alphanumeric
// but not *only* numeric,
// at least 6 characters long,
// and cast it to a string
$filter->validate('username')->is('alnum');
$filter->validate('username')->isNot('int');
$filter->validate('username')->is('strlenMin', 6);
$filter->sanitize('username')->to('string');

// the password must be at least 6 characters long, and must match a
// confirmation field
$filter->validate('password')->is('strlenMin', 6);
$filter->validate('password_confirm')->is('equalToField', 'password');
?>
```

We can call one of the following methods after `validate()`:

- `is(...)` to specify that the value **must** match the rule
- `isNot(...)` to specify that the value **must not** match the rule
- `isBlankOr(...)` to specify that the value may be blank, or that it **must**
  match the rule
- `isBlankOrNot(...)` to specify that the value may be blank, or that it
  **must not** match the rule

We can call one of the following methods after `sanitize()`:

- `to(...)` to specify the value should be changed according to the rule
- `toBlankOr(...)` to specify that blank values should be changed to `null`,
  and that non-blank values should be changed according to the rule
- `useBlankValue(...)` to specify what blank values should be changed to (default `null`)

For more about blanks, see the section on [Blank Values](#blank-values).

### Applying The Filter

We can then apply the filter specifications to the subject. A `true` result
means all the rules passed, while `false` means one or more failed.

```php
<?php
// the data to be filtered; could also be an object
$subject = array(
    'username' => 'bolivar',
    'password' => 'p@55w0rd',
    'password_confirm' => 'p@55word', // not the same!
);

// filter the object and see if there were failures
$success = $filter->apply($subject);
if (! $success) {
    // get the failure messages
    $messages = $filter->getMessages();
    var_export($messages);
}
?>
```

### Failure Modes And Messages

Normally, the filter will stop filtering any field that fails one of
its rules, but will continue applying rules to the rest of the fields. Also,
the filter specification will provide a default message when a rule fails.

We can modify that behavior by specifying a failure mode, with an optional
custom message:

- `$filter->...->asSoftRule('custom message')` will cause the filter to keep
  applying rules to the field, even when a field rule fails.

- `$filter->...->asHardRule('custom message')` is the default behavior. If the
  rule fails, the filter will not apply any more rules to that field, but it
  will keep filtering other fields.

- `$filter->...->asStopRule('custom message')` will cause the filter to stop
  applying rules to all fields and return immediately if the rule fails. That
  is, the filter will not apply any more rules to any more fields.

In each case, the custom message will be used instead of the default one for
the specified rule.  If we want to just set a custom message without changing
the failure mode, we can use `$filter->...->setMessage('custom message')`.

If a field fails multiple rules, there will be multiple failure messages. To
specify a single failure message for a field, regardless of which rule(s) it
fails, call `$filter->useFieldMessage()`:

```php
<?php
$filter->validate('field')->isNot('blank')->asSoftRule();
$filter->validate('field')->is('alnum')->asSoftRule();
$filter->validate('field')->is('strlenMin', 6)->asSoftRule();
$filter->validate('field')->is('strlenMax', 12)->asSoftRule();

$filter->useFieldMessage('field', 'Please use 6-12 alphanumeric characters.');
?>
```

We can get the list of failure messages by calling `$filter->getMessages()`.

### Blank Values

This library incorporates the concept of "blank" fields, as distinct from
`isset()` and `empty()`, to allow for input elements that are missing or have
not been filled in. A field is blank if it is:

- not set in the subject being filtered,
- set to `null`,
- an empty string (''), or
- a string composed of only whitespace characters.

Integers, floats, booleans, resources, arrays, and objects are never "blank"
even if they evaluate to zero or are empty:

```php
<?php
$not_blank = array(
    0,                // integer
    0.00,             // float
    false,            // boolean false
    array(),          // empty array
    new StdClass,     // an object
);
?>
```

#### Allowing For Blank Values

Generally, a blank field will fail to validate. To allow a validate rule to pass
even if the field is blank, call `isBlankOr()` or `isBlankOrNot()` on its rule
specification:

```php
<?php
// either an alphanumeric value *or* a blank value will validate
$filter->validate('field')->isBlankOr('alnum');
?>
```
Likewise, a blank field may fail to sanitize properly. To allow for a blank
field with a sanitize rule, call `toBlankOr()` on its rule specification:

```php
<?php
// both an alphanumeric field *and* a blank field will pass
$filter->sanitize('field')->toBlankOr('alnum');
?>
```

This will cause blank values to be sanitized to `null`, and non-blank values
to be sanitized using the `alnum` rule.

Finally, if we want blank values to be sanitized to something other than
`null`, call `useBlankValue()` to specify the value to use when blank:

```php
<?php
// both an alphanumeric field *and* a blank field will pass
$filter->sanitize('field')->toBlankOr('alnum')->useBlankValue('');
?>
```

That will cause blank values to be sanitized to an empty string. Additionally,
please note that `useBlankValue()` implies `toBlankOr()`, so the following has
the same effect as the above:

```php
<?php
// both an alphanumeric field *and* a blank field will pass
$filter->sanitize('field')->to('alnum')->useBlankValue('');
?>
```
